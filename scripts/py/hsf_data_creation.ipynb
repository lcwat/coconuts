    "#### Creating data for sequential choice models\n",
    "The series of models I plan to use in my thesis project, inspired by habitat-selection functions from movement ecology, use environmental covariates of available resources (e.g., distance from current location, turning angle from previous bearing angle, size/point value, etc.) to predict whether a resource will be chosen next. By specifying a series of models containing different parameters, I will fit different cognitive heuristic strategies to human sequential choice data and determine parameters of significance to the foraging strategies of participants.
